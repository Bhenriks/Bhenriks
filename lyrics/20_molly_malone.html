    <h2 style="text-align: center;">20. MOLLY MALONE</h2>
    <pre style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">
In Dublin's fair city
Where the girls are so pretty
I first set my eyes on sweet Molly Malone
As she wheeled her wheelbarrow
Through the streets, broad and narrow
Crying, "Cockles and mussels, alive, alive, oh"

Alive, alive, oh
Alive, alive, oh
Crying, "Cockles and mussels, alive, alive, oh"

She was a fishmonger
And sure it was no wonder
For so were her father and mother before
And they wheeled their barrow
Through the streets, broad and narrow
Crying, "Cockles and mussels, alive, alive, oh"

Alive, alive, oh
Alive, alive, oh
Crying, "Cockles and mussels, alive, alive, oh"

She died of a fever
And sure, no one could save her
And that was the end of sweet Molly Malone
Now her ghost wheels, her barrow
Through the streets, broad and narrow
Crying, "Cockles and mussels, alive, alive, oh"

Alive, alive, oh
Alive, alive, oh
Crying, "Cockles and mussels, alive, alive, oh"
Alive, alive, oh
Alive, alive, oh
Crying, "Cockles and mussels, alive, alive, oh"
